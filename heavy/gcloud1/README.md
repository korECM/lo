# Deploy Fiber to Google Cloud with Firebase

Examples on how to run an application using Fiber on Google Cloud.

#### Running Locally

* Run on the command line:
```
go run cmd/main.go
```

#### Deploy using Google Cloud Run

This step will build a Docker Image, publish to Google Cloud Registry and deploy on Cloud Run Managed enviroment.

After deploying the server on Cloud Run, you can get it's url on GCP Console ([link](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)) and select the service `gcloud-fiber` that we just deployed. Them copy the URL will look like `https://{project-id}-{some-random-hash-string}.a.run.app`.

Or you can do it manually with those steps:

* Run on the command line:
```
export GCLOUD_PROJECT=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
gcloud builds submit â€” -tag gcr.io/$GCLOUD_PROJECT/gcloud-fiber .
gcloud beta run deploy --platform managed --image gcr.io/$GCLOUD_PROJECT/gcloud-fiber
```

#### Deploy using Google App Engine

This step will deploy the app to Google App Engine Standard Go enviroment. The app configuration and additional configurations can be tweaked on the `app.yaml` file.

* Run on the command line:
```
gcloud app deploy
```

#### Deploy using Google Cloud Function

This step will deploy a HTTP Cloud Function using Go enviroment. You can use the `deploy.sh` script. Just edit your project id on it.

For the Cloud Functions env, Google enforces us to deploy a function that is a `http.HandlerFunc`, so on the file `functions.go` there is a workaround to reroute the HTTP call to the Fiber app instance.

* Run on the command line:
```
gcloud functions deploy MyCloudFunction --runtime go111 --trigger-http
```
